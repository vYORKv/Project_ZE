To-Do List

1) Figure out proper input handling, and stop all inputs while player is dead.
	- Likely place an "if" statement to catch every input that needs to be 
	disabled while player is dead, excluding all inputs that are available 
	outside of gameplay (hitting esc for menu, etc.)
*2) Create longer zombie aggro audio files
***3) Build out Solo Run level with full scripting and ai pathing
4) Bleeding Animated Sprite
5) Place corpse pngs inside of effect_sprite
**6) Create blood variations (both human and z) and all player corpses
7) Hitpoints bar
**8) Add variations to zombie death cry
***9) Fix tilesets for building interiors
