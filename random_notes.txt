Hierarchy of Stimulus: Sight -> Sound -> Mod Mentality


Current bat swing implementation just turns on a zone and turns it off. Need
to see if there's a reliable way to place a hitbox on the bat as it moves to 
follow its swing. Might not work because the bat is just a sprite2d node. Would
likely work with a 2d node with the bat sprite under it.


In MP, should have meta zombie spawns all around the map. When they spawn, 
they should be given an array of all players in match. They should then check 
and see if all players in map are alive, still connected to the server
(although, when a player disconnects, they should die), or if they have not 
extracted from the map. If any of these conditions are false, they should 
remove that player from their array. After this check, the remaining players 
should be checked for their distance. The closest player should then be made 
their current meta target. Every physics process, the zombies should check if 
their current meta target is dead. If it isn't, they should pursue the player 
until dead. If it is, they should start the checks for each player again, purging 
all dead from the array, and selecting the closest player as their new target.


FIX ALL INTANCES (IN ENTIRE PROGRAM) OF GET_PARENT.ADD_CHILD to ADD_CHILD ONLY
Need to pay close attention to get_parent().add_child() and add_child(). Nodes
that are children of levels are able to use "get_parent().add_child()," but
all "levels" should only use "add_child()" by itself. Otherwise, this creates
the "meta scenes" like enemy units that always exist in the program regardless
of where you are. (An example of this is zombies actually moving to and
existing inside of my main menu when leaving the level and going back to the
main menu)
