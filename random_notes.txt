Hierarchy of Stimulus: Sight -> Sound -> Mod Mentality


Current bat swing implementation just turns on a zone and turns it off. Need
to see if there's a reliable way to place a hitbox on the bat as it moves to 
follow its swing. Might not work because the bat is just a sprite2d node. Would
likely work with a 2d node with the bat sprite under it.
