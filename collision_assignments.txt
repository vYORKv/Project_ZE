Layer - The layer the collision object exists on (the layer it can be detected).
Mask - The layer the object is monitoring for other collision objects.

Collision Mask Question
So from what I understand, Collision Layer is where the node is, and 
Collision Mask is where it looks for objects to collide with.

So if the player is on Layer 1, and the Mask is 1 and 2, it will be able to 
collide with all nodes that have a Layer 1 and/or Layer 2, no matter what that 
node has in the Collision Mask. Is that correct? (YES)

And consider this situation:

A is on layer 1 and has a mask on 2

B is on layer 2 and has no mask

A will detect a collision with B if my understanding is correct. But will B 
detect a collision with A? As in will the signal "_on_B_body_entered(body)" be 
called when A enters into B? (NO, B is not monitoring any layers. Can't detect,
but can "be detected on its layer").
