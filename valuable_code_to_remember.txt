### to_global function and returning cast endpoint global_position ###
	*** ray.to_global(ray.target_position) ***
	The to_global function can convert children nodes' local position 
	(relative to the parent node) to a global position. This will not work on
	the parent node itself. Obviously, this is incredibly useful for finding
	the endpoint of a raycast. Other valuable uses should follow.
